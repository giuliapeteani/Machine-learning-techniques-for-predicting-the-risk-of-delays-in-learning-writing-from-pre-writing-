Dysgraphia is a specific learning disability that affects the fundamental functions of handwriting in 
absence of any intellectual and neurological deficits. It is associated with difficulties in fine motor 
skills, often related to problems in praxic skills

- **Data**: data collected with serious games for iPad, aimed at testing different characteristics of 
handwriting through pregraphic symbols. 
We focused on the analysis of alterations in the characteristics of 
handwriting and on the violations of the Isocrony and the Speed Accuracy Trade-off principles. 
The analysis of the confounders (age, gender, dominant hand, language, use of tablet) was carried out on
these features, and datasets were created to train and evaluate a predictive model.

The impact of confounders was negligible, while a total of 22 features were selected as useful for the 
prediction.

- **Predictive Model**:

The predictive model was able to identify subjects at risk of delay in learning of 
handwriting, with a improvement of 25% compared to a baseline predictor. 

The most relevant innovation of the work consists in the possibility to objectively predict children at 
risk of a delay in learning graphical abilities, excluding the subjective component introduced by the 
teachers’ judgement, thanks to a quantitative analysis of pregraphic symbols, since pre-scholar age. 
In this way, those who will be identified as subjects at risk will have the opportunituy to undergo to 
an empowerment program and simultaneously will be monitored in order to observe their graphic 
abilities’ evolution, even at distance of years, with the aim of confirm the predictions.
